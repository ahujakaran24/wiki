In addition to the verified tokens in the 0x token registry, we allow users to add any
arbitrary ERC20 token to 0x Portal and to generate orders involving these tokens. Since
you might be filling an order involving an unknown token, it is very important you verify
its legitimacy before filling the order. **Many scammers will try to steal your funds by
trading your legitimate tokens for their fake tokens**.

#### How to verify a token's legitimacy

When filling an order on OTC, click on the unregistered token's icon next to its address as shown below:

</div>

This will bring you to the token's contract page on Etherscan. Here you can see if this token has been whitelisted by the [Etherscan Token Tracker](https://etherscan.io/tokens) by checking if there is a link to a token tracker entry as shown below.

</div>

Keep in mind that only popular tokens are added to Etherscan's token tracker. If the token you are trading is not very popular, the only full-proof way to validate the token's legitimacy is by checking that the **token address** matches that of the token you think you are trading.

For this, you will need to find the actual token address through a trusted source (the project's website, Twitter channel, etc...) and make sure that the two addresses match. **If they don't, then you are dealing with an identically named scam token.**

Good luck and stay safe!
